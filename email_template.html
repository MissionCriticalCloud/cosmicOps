Hello {{ firstname }},
<br><br>
Due to the migration to SBP.cloud, we have started to clean-up BETA MCC. This means all stopped VMs, unattached disks and other unused resources will be deleted.
<br><br>
<b>In MCC {{ zone }} you have the following resources:</b>
<br><br>
<table>
{{ resource_text }}
</table>
<br><br>
The stopped VMs, disks that are not attached and other unused resources will be deleted on or after April 1st 2023. No action is required from your side, unless you want to keep them. In this case, just start your VM or attach your disk. Then we will know it is still being used.
<br><br>
Be aware, MCC environment will be decommissioned in Q4 2023. Please migrate to SBP.cloud.
<br><br>
Kind regards,
<br>MCC Team
